# Month 2
## Week 1
This week's task was to build a Color Flipper. Also we had built this task with a partner by pair programming. My partner in this task was [Darshil](https://github.com/darshil-here). We have deployed our task on this [site](https://cc-and-dp-task.netlify.app/).

Here are the images of the task.
