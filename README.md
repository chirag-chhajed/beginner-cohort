# Crework's Beginner Cohort

Crework's Beginner Cohort is a 6 months program to help you go from 0 to 1 in your web development journey. You can start from scratch and become a full stack developer backed by projects, sessions and guidance from experts in 24 weeks.

In simple words we are a community or one of the best community. We start on a same agenda to become a Web Developer. The main motive to start with a community is because if you struggle with consistency, you start with it and a doubt comes and now you are struggling with it, You sometimes don't find good resources. Crework helps with all of it. At Crework both the mentors and Community Leads are really supportive, super chill and they will help you with peskiest of the doubt and would cheer you for the smallest of the achievements. The Cohort's primary goal is to promote community involvement as well as your growth as a web developer. 

I feel fortunate to have been given the chance to be a part of this cohort because it is the first for Crework. This Github project incorporates every learning from the cohort. The Cohort is currently ongoing.
