# Crework's Begineer Cohort

Crework's Beginner Cohort is a 6 months program to help you go from 0 to 1 in your web development journey. You can start from scratch and become a full stack developer backed by projects, sessions and guidance from our experts in 24 weeks.

In simple words we are a community or one of the best community. We start on a same agenda to become a Web Developer. The main motive to start with a community is because if you struggle with consistency, you start with it and a doubt comes and now you are struggling with it. You sometimes don't find good resources. At Crework both the mentors and Community Leads are really supportive, super chill. They will help you with peckiest of the doubt and would cheer you for the smallest of the achievements. The main motive of the Cohort is not just to make you a Web Developer but also promote interaction between the people of the community.
